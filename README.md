# Nxtest

This project was generated using [Nx](https://nx.dev).

üîé **Smart, Extensible Build Framework**

**A test repository trying out our new back end tech stack plus Express**

A repository for testing out Prisma, PostgreSql, Apollo Server, GraphQl, and Express all in the NX build framework

### Database Connection

This repository is currently connected to a local database through PostgreSql which is managed by Prisma

To connect to your local database

Go to the `scheme.prisma` file which is found in the `prisma` folder

Enter your `database url` to set up the connection to your database

## Create and Seed the database

Run the following command to create your PostgreSql database file. This also create the `user` and `post` tables that are defined in [`prisma/schema.prisma`](./prisma/schema.prisma):

`npx prisma migrate dev --name init`

Now, see the database with the sample data in [`prisma/seed.ts`](./prisma/seed.ts) by running the following command:

`npx prisma db seed --preview-feature`

### Start Apollo Server

Run `nx serve prisma-test` in the command line

### GraphQL

Copy query below to test in the apollo server

```graphql
query ExampleQuery {
  feed {
    id
    title
    content
    published
    author {
      id
      name
      email
    }
  }
}
```

### Start Prisma Studio

Run `npx prisma studio` in the command line

If the database is up - you can create, read, update, or delete the data 


## More CLI Commands and NX information


## Generate an application

Run `nx g @nrwl/react:app my-app` to generate an application.

> You can use any of the plugins above to generate applications as well.

When using Nx, you can create multiple applications and libraries in the same workspace.

## Generate a library

Run `nx g @nrwl/react:lib my-lib` to generate a library.

> You can also use any of the plugins above to generate libraries as well.

Libraries are shareable across libraries and applications. They can be imported from `@nxtest/mylib`.

## Development server

Run `nx serve my-app` for a dev server. Navigate to http://localhost:4200/. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `nx g @nrwl/react:component my-component --project=my-app` to generate a new component.

## Build

Run `nx build my-app` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `nx test my-app` to execute the unit tests via [Jest](https://jestjs.io).

Run `nx affected:test` to execute the unit tests affected by a change.

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e my-app` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io).

Run `nx affected:e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests affected by a change.

## Understand your workspace

Run `nx dep-graph` to see a diagram of the dependencies of your projects.
